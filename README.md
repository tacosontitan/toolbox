## 🛠️ Development

This project is built using Node.js and TypeScript. After installing Node.js, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone
npm install
```

After cloning and installing dependencies, you'll need to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript. You can do this by running:

```bash
npx tsc
```

You're now ready to debug the extension!
